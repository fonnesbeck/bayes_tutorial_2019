    "At this point, it is worth addressing the question of why one might consider an alternative statistical paradigm to the classical/frequentist statistical approach. After all, it is not always easy to specify a full probabilistic model, nor to obtain output from the model once it is specified. So, why bother?\n",
    "\n",
    "> ... the Bayesian approach is attractive because it is useful. Its usefulness derives in large measure from its simplicity. Its simplicity allows the investigation of far more complex models than can be handled by the tools in the classical toolbox.  \n",
    "*-- Link and Barker 2010*\n",
    "\n",
    "We already noted that there is just one estimator in Bayesian inference, which lends to its ***simplicity***. Moreover, Bayes affords a conceptually simple way of coping with multiple parameters; the use of probabilistic models allows very complex models to be assembled in a modular fashion, by factoring a large joint model into the product of several conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is also attractive for its ***coherence***. All unknown quantities for a particular problem are treated as random variables, to be estimated in the same way. Existing knowledge is given precise mathematical expression, allowing it to be integrated with information from the study dataset, and there is formal mechanism for incorporating new information into an existing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Bayesian statistics confers an advantage in the ***iterpretability*** of analytic outputs. Because models are expressed probabilistically, results can be interpreted probabilistically. Probabilities are easy for users (particularly non-technical users) to understand and apply."

    "\n",
    "Recall that for frequentists, unknown parameters are **fixed**, which means there is no probability associated with them being any value except what they are fixed to. Here, the interval itself, and not \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is the random variable. The actual interval calculated from the data is just one possible realization of a random process, and it must be strictly interpreted only in relation to an infinite sequence of identical trials that might be (but never are) conducted in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid interpretation of the above would be:\n",

    "> If the experiment were repeated an infinite number of times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain \\\\(\\theta\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the statistical notion of \"confidence\" entails, and this sets it apart from probability intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since they regard unknown parameters as random variables, Bayesians can and do use probability intervals to describe what is known about the value of an unknown quantity. These intervals are commonly known as ***credible intervals***.\n",

    "> There is a 95% chance \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is between \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).\n",

    "## Example: Genetic probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put Bayesian inference into action using a very simple example. I've chosen this example because it is one of the rare occasions where the posterior can be calculated by hand. We will show how data can be used to update our belief in competing hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hemophilia is a rare genetic disorder that impairs the ability for the body's clotting factors to coagualate the blood in response to broken blood vessels. The disease is an **x-linked recessive** trait, meaning that there is only one copy of the gene in males but two in females, and the trait can be masked by the dominant allele of the gene. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that males with 1 gene are *affected*, while females with 1 gene are unaffected, but *carriers* of the disease. Having 2 copies of the disease is fatal, so this genotype does not exist in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, consider a woman whose mother is a carrier (because her brother is affected) and who marries an unaffected man. Let's now observe some data: the woman has two consecutive (non-twin) sons who are unaffected. We are interested in determining **if the woman is a carrier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![hemophilia](images/hemophilia.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up this problem, we need to set up our probability model. The unknown quantity of interest is simply an indicator variable \\\\(W\\\\) that equals 1 if the woman is affected, and zero if she is not. We are interested in the probability that the variable equals one, given what we have observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[Pr(W=1 | s_1=0, s_2=0)\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Our prior information is based on what we know about the woman's ancestry: her mother was a carrier. Hence, the prior is \\\\(Pr(W=1) = 0.5\\\\). Another way of expressing this is in terms of the **prior odds**, or:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[O(W=1) = \\frac{Pr(W=1)}{Pr(W=0)} = 1\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the likelihood: The form of this function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[L(W | s_1=0, s_2=0)\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be calculated as the probability of observing the data for any passed value for the parameter. For this simple problem, the likelihood takes only two possible values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "L(W=1 &| s_1=0, s_2=0) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25 \\cr\n",
    "L(W=0 &| s_1=0, s_2=0) = (1)(1) = 1\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the pieces in place, we can now apply Bayes' formula to calculate the posterior probability that the woman is a carrier:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "Pr(W=1 | s_1=0, s_2=0) &= \\frac{L(W=1 | s_1=0, s_2=0) Pr(W=1)}{L(W=1 | s_1=0, s_2=0) Pr(W=1) + L(W=0 | s_1=0, s_2=0) Pr(W=0)} \\cr\n",
    " &= \\frac{(0.25)(0.5)}{(0.25)(0.5) + (1)(0.5)} \\cr\n",
    " &= 0.2\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, there is a 0.2 probability of the woman being a carrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its a bit trivial, but we can code this in Python:"
